# Comical

This is an old project I wrote a few years ago. It's a fully functioning game engine for a open-world, 2D platformer/shooter. Single-handedly built from scratch using Python and Pygame, a wrapper for the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. I've uploaded it here for archiving purposes.

##NOTICE:
There are a few files from this project that are stored in a .zip file named 'Comical Dependencies.zip'. Specifically, It contains a number of .flip files that must be extracted to './EngineControl/GamePlayObjects/FlipBooks/', otherwise the project will crash.

Additionally, it contains a folder named 'Python27', which is the Python Interpreter that the 'Game Launcher.exe' uses. If you want to use it (recommended), extract this folder to the project's root directory.
